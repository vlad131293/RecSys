## Task:
### 2. Quantifying transition from cold-start to warm-start regime  
Recall, cold-start and warm-start users are users not present in the training data. The difference between  
them is that the former have no rating information at all, while for the latter some amount of ratings is  
already available.  
It remains unclear, though, whether recommendations based on a few ratings of a warm-start user will be  
better than recommendations generated by a hybrid model for purely cold-start regime (i.e., without using  
rating info). A few items may still be not very representative of actual user preferences. Hence, finding the  
minimum number of items required for reliable predictions in the warm start instead of the cold start is of  
high practical interest. It may help improve overall user experience.  
Pick a hybrid model. Try to find a threshold that defines the minimum amount of seen interactions of  
a warm-start user for which switching from cold-start predictions to standard folding-in leads to a better  
quality of recommendations. Perform a comprehensive experiment with optimized hybrid models of your  
choice on at least 2 datasets and report your results. Note that the threshold value can be different on  
different datasets.
